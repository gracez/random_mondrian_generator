# Recursive Mondrian Generator

- The script is contained in `mondrian_generator.py`
- To create a Mondrian painting of order n, run `paint_mondrian(n)` followed by `plt.show()`
- The larger the choice of n, the more complicated the painting (more lines and rectangles drawn)
- recommended n is between 2 and 4

A gallery of examples can be viewed in the `gallery` directory. There is one example of order 1, two examples each of orders 2, 3, 4, and one example of order 8.
For order 8, the linewidth was changed from 8 to 1 for better aesthetics.
